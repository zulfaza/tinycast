Check existing [issues](https://github.com/abue-ammar/tinycast/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/abue-ammar/tinycast/pulls) first.

> **Don't hurry your code. Make sure it works well and is well designed. Don't worry about timing.**

## Non-negotiables

- **RAM.** Under 100 MB, always. No feature is worth going over.
- **No leaks.** Leak-test before you submit. Zero leaks, no retain cycles, memory back to baseline
  after the palette closes.
- **Design.** New UI must look like it shipped with the app — spacing, type, radii and motion from the
  existing tokens ([`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md)). If you genuinely need a new one, justify it in the PR.
- **No bloat.** Tinycast stays small on purpose — quality over quantity. A clean patch still gets
  declined if the feature isn't worth its weight, so open an issue and settle that before you build.
- **Never break the Non-negotiables** in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Setup

- macOS 26+, Xcode 26. Do the one-time signing setup
  ([`docs/signing.md`](docs/signing.md) §1).
- `open Tinycast.xcodeproj` → ⌘R. Debug builds are their own channel (`Tinycast Dev.app`).
- After editing `project.yml`: `xcodegen generate`, commit the result. No SwiftPM.
- Details: [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md). Architecture:
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Start at [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

## Before submitting

- **A linked issue marked `approved`.** Put `Closes #<number>` in the PR description. A PR that
  doesn't close an `approved` issue is closed automatically the moment it opens — fix the link and
  reopen it. Docs-only changes (`*.md`, `docs/`, `website/`) skip the check.
- The whole bar in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md#definition-of-done) passes — harnesses, lint,
  purity, a clean build. Engine changes come with new cases. CI runs the harnesses and lint — it
  annotates lint violations on your diff — but does **not** build the app, so **build locally**: a PR
  that doesn't compile still looks green.
- Leak-tested and memory-measured. Numbers in the PR.
- You actually used the app, on your path and the ones next to it.
- Rebased on `main`, squashed into logical commits.
- Anything in [`docs/`](docs/) your change makes wrong is fixed.
- **Read your own diff top to bottom before you open the PR.** Most review comments are things the
  author would have caught on a second pass.
- You agree to the
  [Contributor License and Feedback Agreement](CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AND_FEEDBACK_AGREEMENT.md).
  Opening a PR is your acceptance.

## Pull requests

- Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) — every section, or say why it doesn't
  apply.
- **Visual change → side-by-side before/after video. Mandatory.** Same window size, same actions.
  An "after"-only clip doesn't count; stills don't substitute.
- Non-visual → say what you tested.
- Include the memory numbers, idle and peak.
- Flag anything surprising, and any tradeoff you made on purpose.

## Code style

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first — the posture, the Non-negotiables and the naming and comment rules
are all there, and they apply to a human contributor exactly as they do to an agent.
[`docs/standards.md`](docs/standards.md) is the full version: architecture, naming, Swift style,
concurrency and the performance budgets. [`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md) before any new view or restyle. Look before "fixing" something that looks
wrong — it may be deliberate.

Two things that are only about contributing, and so are not in those docs:

- Commit messages imperative: `Add per-app hotkey toggle`.
- Behaviour you didn't mean to change, didn't change. Say so explicitly in the PR if it did.

## Bugs

macOS version, Tinycast version + channel, steps, expected vs actual. A recording beats a paragraph.
