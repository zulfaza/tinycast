# UI & Design System

The design system for Tinycast's UI, written so an agent restyling or extending it stays consistent
with what's already there. This documents **Tinycast as built** — every rule here maps to code in
`Tinycast/`. `DesignSystem/Theme.swift` is the single design-token source.

Read this before touching any view body, `Theme` value, or the panel chrome.

---

## The look, in one paragraph

Tinycast is a **command palette**: a borderless floating panel whose surface is just the
OS behind-window blur under a 40% black scrim — there is no gray chrome. Everything on that surface is
white at a fixed alpha ramp. The header and bottom bar **float over the list as fully transparent
overlays**; there are no hard-edged bars, strips, or dividers. Rows don't clip under the bars, they
**dissolve**: a scroll-driven gradient mask ghosts them as they pass beneath. Floating controls (the
action pill, the menu circle, popover menus) are **Liquid Glass**.

That paragraph describes **Dark**, which is the design. Light is the same design with the ink
inverted: a white scrim over the same blur, and a black-alpha ramp at matched stops. Nothing about
geometry, type, motion or state changes between them.

Five load-bearing ideas, in priority order:

1. **Surface = scrim over behind-window blur.** No solid backgrounds. Depth comes from the desktop showing through.
2. **One alpha ramp, never grays.** Ink at fixed stops — white over the dark surface, black over the light one.
3. **Floating bars, not chrome.** Header/footer are transparent overlays; the list fills the whole panel.
4. **Edges dissolve, they don't clip.** Scroll-driven mask, no separators between list and bars.
5. **Glass only on floating controls.** The main surface is never glass; pills/menus/circles are.

## Non-negotiable invariants

These are the things that quietly break the look if changed. Preserve them unless the task is explicitly to change them.

- **Dark is the baseline and its values are frozen.** Every `Theme.Colors` token resolves per appearance, and its **dark branch is the literal the forced-dark build shipped** — restated, never recomputed. Retune a light branch freely; touch a dark one only when the task is to change Dark. `AppCore.applyAppearance()` is the only place an appearance is assigned, from `AppSettings.appearance`; `.system` assigns `nil` so AppKit follows macOS.
- **New colors go through `Theme.Colors.ramp(dark:light:)`** (an alpha that inverts) or `adaptive(dark:light:)` (two explicit `NSColor`s, for anything that isn't a plain inversion — `panelScrim`, `layoutPreviewGround`). Never a bare `Color.white.opacity(…)` in a view: it disappears in Light.
- **No grays, no opaque fills on the surface.** Reach for `Theme.Colors.*` instead of `.gray`, `NSColor.windowBackground`, etc.
- **Three things stay fixed in both appearances, on purpose.** The `EdgeDissolve`/`OverflowFade` gradients are **mask luminance, not color** — inverting them breaks the dissolve everywhere. `ExtensionTintColors` and a tinted `IconCache` tile keep white ink, because a saturated tile carries its own contrast. And `IconCache` cannot use a dynamic `NSColor` at all: it rasterizes off-main, so the surface is carried explicitly and is part of the cache key.
- **An icon is drawn for a surface *and* a system icon style, and both move under you.** macOS restyles the icons `NSWorkspace` hands out when System Settings → Appearance → **Icon & widget style** changes, so `IconStyleMonitor` and Tinycast's own appearance both call `IconCache.invalidateStyled()`. **The monitor may not invalidate on the notification itself.** AppKit posts `NSWorkspaceIconAppearanceConfigurationDidChange` before IconServices has swapped what `NSWorkspace` vends — measured at 25–120ms behind, jittering run to run — and the images it hands back are live objects macOS restyles in place, so flattening one on the signal freezes the *outgoing* style into a bitmap nothing ever invalidates again. `IconStyleMonitor` therefore polls `IconCache.styleFingerprint()` until the pixels actually move, and only then invalidates. Waiting also sidesteps the cost: re-flattening every icon the instant a restyle begins forces a cold IconServices regeneration, measured at 160× the settled draw cost. That drops the cached bitmaps, bumps every cache key so an in-flight decode cannot repopulate a stale one, and moves `IconCache.style.generation`. **Any view that draws an icon must key its fetch on that generation** — wrap the view's own key in `IconRequest`, or call `IconCache.observeStyle()` where the icon is resolved synchronously in a `body`. It is reached through `IconCache` rather than injected precisely because icons are drawn in menus, popovers and every list, where a missed injection would be a silent staleness bug.
- **No hard dividers between the list and the bars.** The header and bottom bar are `safeAreaInset` overlays with no background; separation comes from `edgeDissolve()`, nothing else. (One deliberate exception: the vertical hairline between a list and its preview pane, as the clipboard and file search screens draw.)
- **The panel corner is clipped once, at the root.** `RootPaletteView.body` ends with `.background(panelScrim) → .background(GlassEffectView()) → .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(26, .continuous))`. Keep that order; the scrim goes _over_ the glass, and the clip is last.
- **Don't use the native scroll edge effect.** Inside a transparent panel it renders a hard-bounded rectangle. Use `edgeDissolve()`, or a gradient `mask` where a surface owns its own fade — `scrollEdgeEffectStyle` draws a *material* where a scroll view meets a safe area, so over a panel that already has `panelScrim` + `GlassEffectView` it composites to nothing. Tried and rejected on `QuickActionResultView`, with and without `safeAreaBar`. This is a rule about the borderless panels; the Settings window is a titled `NSWindow` whose system titlebar draws the band itself (see "Settings").
- **Test over a light desktop.** Transparency and corner masking bugs only show over bright wallpaper. Dark wallpaper hides them.
- **No `NSAlert` or system popovers.** Every confirmation, failure report, value prompt and transient readout is Tinycast's own SwiftUI surface (see "Dialogs & HUD"). An Aqua alert on an alpha-over-vibrancy app reads as a different product, and its `runModal` run loop keeps Carbon hotkeys firing underneath.
- **A dialog has three independent axes; never let one infer another.** The **icon** (`DialogRequest.symbol`, required) is always the *subject's* own glyph — a command being confirmed uses its `SystemAction.sfSymbol`, so the Restart dialog shows the same icon as the Restart row. Tone never picks an icon. The **tone** (`DialogTone`: `.neutral` / `.success` / `.danger`) tints only that glyph. The **button** takes its color from `DialogAction.Role` (`.standard` white / `.destructive` red / `.cancel` secondary), so a red-glyph security warning can still carry a plain white button — as "Import executable commands?" does.
- **Resolve every glyph through `SymbolImage`, not `Image(systemName:)`.** Some catalog symbols are bundled assets in `Assets.xcassets` (`toggleBluetooth`), and `Image(systemName:)` silently renders nothing for those.
- **↵ runs the primary action, Escape cancels, and Cancel always renders leading** (the left button), matching macOS convention. A button never prints its key cap; a deliberate hover reveals its outlined `KeyCapChip` in a `Tooltip`.
- **In the palette, a hover label is Tinycast's `tooltip`, never `.help()`**: an AppKit tooltip never appears while the app sits inactive behind the non-activating panel. A Settings window activates the app, so `.help()` shows there and stays the label to use. The tooltip hangs above its control by default; a control in the palette header passes `edge: .bottom`, since above it is off the window, and a label may run to several lines — the chat's attachment pill lists every staged name.
- **A transient readout is a HUD, not a dialog.** `VolumeHUDController`'s box is volume and mute only, since that one needs an actual level and number; every other success or info confirmation goes through `MessageHUDController`'s pill, whose trailing glyph *is* its `DialogTone`. A pill has no subject to name, so the icon rule above does not apply to it — and that mapping stays file-scoped so nothing can reach for it when building a `DialogRequest`. A new HUD means a new presenter, not a second shape bolted onto an existing controller.
- **Glass is for floating controls, with dialogs as the deliberate modal exception.** The action capsule, menu circle and `PopoverMenu` use it inside the palette; dialogs apply one system `.glassEffect(.regular)` to their root surface. Dialog buttons stay matte so their roles remain legible. Both HUDs keep the lighter `panelScrim` → `GlassEffectView()` → `clipShape` recipe.

## Tokens

Source: `Tinycast/DesignSystem/Theme.swift`.

`Theme` is the single source of truth. **Never hardcode a spacing/radius/size/color that has a token.**
Add a token rather than a magic number when introducing a new value.

### Interface Size (`InterfaceMetrics`)

`AppSettings.interfaceSize` scales the palette and the surfaces that float with it — the ⌘K menu, the
extension list panel, Quick Actions, dialogs and HUDs. Settings, Onboarding,
Support, Update, About and Notes never scale.

`DesignSystem/InterfaceMetrics.swift` stores **only a scale** and derives every value from the `Theme`
literal, so `Theme` stays the one place a number is written down. **In any view a scaled surface can
reach, read `@Environment(\.metrics)` rather than `Theme.Spacing/Radius/Size/Typography`** — the key
defaults to `.standard`, so a shared `DesignSystem/` component renders unscaled in Settings without
being forked. An AppKit site reads `settings.interfaceSize.metrics` where it computes its frame.

A length measured against the **screen** does not scale; a length measured against **our own content**
does. So `hairline`, `paletteTopMarginFraction`, `paletteSnapDistance`, `paletteMinimumVisible`, the
drop-guide dashes, `hudEdgeOffset` and every row *count* stay on `Theme`, as does every chrome token.

Scaling rounds to whole points, once, at the leaf accessor. A **derived** token composes already
scaled parts (`compactHeight`, `menuRowHeight`) rather than scaling the derived result, so an AppKit
frame can never disagree with the SwiftUI view inside it by a point. `interface-size-test` pins all of
this, member by member, including that `.standard` is `Theme` verbatim.

### Spacing (`Theme.Spacing`)

`xxs 2` · `xs 4` · `sm 6` · `md 8` · `lg 10` · `xl 12` · `dialogInset 18` · `xxl 20`

`xxs` is the tight gap between adjacent keycap chips (used everywhere keycaps sit side by side).

Row content insets are `md`; list horizontal inset is `md`; the search icon aligns with rows via `md * 2`.

Section-header rhythm has two dedicated tokens: `sectionHeaderBottom` (header → first row) and
`sectionSpacing` (gap above every header **except the list's first**, which reads as the previous
section's closing padding). The emoji grid uses the roomier `emojiSectionSpacing` between its tile
groups. See "Section headers" below.

### Radius (`Theme.Radius`)

`panel 26` · `row 10` · `card 10` · `dialog 20` · `dialogSymbol 16` · `menuPanel 16` · `menu 6` · `menuRow 10` · `barControl 8` · `thumbnail 6` · `keyCap 6` · `recorderKeyCap 4`

`barControl` dresses the header pop-ups (type filter, AI model), which state a value and drop a menu
the way a native pop-up button does — a rectangle, not a pill.

**The footer action group stays a `Capsule`, and so do the buttons inside it.** It is the primary
action, and the pill is the affordance saying so; squaring it off reads as a toolbar. The capsule
also keeps the pair concentric for free — a capsule's radius is half its height, so the inner
buttons land exactly `Spacing.xs` inside the wrapper without either radius being written down.

Notes has no corner of its own: it clips to `panel`, so the two floating surfaces read as siblings.

`dialog` sits between `menuPanel` and `panel` so a dialog reads as a smaller sibling of the palette, not a second palette.

`menu` is the shared small-control corner (sidebar tiles, About link pills); `menuRow` is the slightly rounder hover highlight behind popover-menu rows.

Always `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius:, style: .continuous)` — continuous corners everywhere, never `.circular`.

#### Concentric corners

**Where two rounded corners sit adjacent and are seen together, the inner radius is the outer radius
minus the gap between them.** Miss it and the curves stop being parallel: the inner corner reads
tight or slack against the one behind it, which is visible long before anyone can name it.

Inside a menu the rule holds exactly, and `menuRow` exists to keep it holding:

| Outer | Gap | Inner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `menuPanel 16` | `Spacing.sm 6` | `menuRow 10` |

**Alignment to a control outranks it.** Every palette menu hangs off a button, and its edge lines up
with that button's — `MenuPanel.inset` is `Spacing.md`, which is `bottomBar`'s own horizontal padding,
and the header menus use `Spacing.md * 2` to meet the header button in its wider gutter. The buttons
sit directly under the menus, so a 2pt disagreement there reads as broken padding, while the same 2pt
against the panel's corner reads as almost nothing. Anchor to the control, then let the corner fall
where it does: `panel 26` against an 8pt gap would want `menuPanel 18`, and it stays 16.

**It applies only where corners actually meet.** A list row sits mid-panel with the header above and
the bottom bar below, so it shares no corner with `panel` and has nothing to be concentric with —
`row 10` is chosen for the row's own size and stays on the shared scale. Forcing the rule there would
round every row to 18 for no reason.

If a pair ever does need closing, **move the gap, not the curve** — but only once you have checked
what else is anchored to that gap. A radius is shared by surfaces across several features, a
placement constant is not: `Radius.menuPanel` alone dresses the ⌘K menu, the extensions actions
panel, the shortcut-recorder callout and the Notes switcher, and `menuRow` is deliberately equal to
`row` so a row pill is one shape everywhere.

### Size (`Theme.Size`)

`panelWidth 750` · `panelHeight 475` · `headerHeight 44` · `bottomBarHeight 52` · `barButtonHeight 28` ·
`rowIcon 24` · `keyCap 18` · `recorderKeyCap 16` · `menuButton 36` · `clipboardListWidth 290` ·
`menuWidth 276` · `clipboardFilterMenuWidth 200` · `fileSearchFilterMenuWidth 200` ·
`emojiCategoryMenuWidth 220` · `menuIcon 20` ·
`emojiGridInset 16` ·
`settingsSidebar 215` · `settingsRowIcon 20` · `dialogCompactWidth 290` ·
`dialogWidth 420` · `dialogButtonHeight 34` · `dialogSymbol 28` · `dialogSymbolContainer 52` ·
`dialogIcon 32` · `hudWidth 200` ·
`hudHeight 100` · `volumeTrackHeight 6` · `volumeReadout 38`

Notes adds `noteWindow 520×420` (opening size on a first run only), `noteWindowMinimum 320×220`,
`noteTitlebar 44`, `noteTitleInset 120`, `noteEditorInset 16`, `noteSearchHeight 34`,
`noteFooterHeight 28`, `noteGlyph 16`, `noteEmptyGlyph 28`, and `noteHeadingMenu 220×159`.

AI Chat adds `aiChatWindow 960×660` (opening size), `aiChatWindowMinimum 680×440`, a sidebar of
`aiChatSidebarMinimum 240`–`aiChatSidebarMaximum 340`, `aiChatDetailMinimum 440`,
`aiChatReadingWidth 760` for the transcript and composer column, `aiChatComposerMaxHeight 180`, and
`chatContextGauge 14` for the composer's context ring, and `chatContextCard 300` for the card it
raises on hover.

`keyCap` sizes the palette's keycap chips; `recorderKeyCap` (both size and radius) is the intentionally-smaller Settings shortcut-recorder chip.

### Typography (`Theme.Typography`)

System text styles only — **no fixed point sizes in views**. Two named exceptions are explicit:
`searchField` (20pt Regular) and the optical SF Symbol treatment `menuSymbol` (14pt Medium). Use
`rowTitle` (`.body`), `sectionHeader` (`.subheadline.medium`),
`rowTrailing`/`bar`/`menuRow`/`keyCap` etc. as named.

`InterfaceMetrics.Typography` scales a style by rebuilding its `NSFont` **from that font's own
descriptor** at the scaled point size. Never reconstruct one as `.system(size:weight:)` from a
hand-written weight table: on macOS `.headline` is Bold and `.caption2` is Medium, so a table
*lightens* them the moment the user leaves the default size. `menuSymbol` is the deliberate exception:
it is an explicitly-sized glyph treatment, not a system text style, so scaling preserves Medium.

### Colors (`Theme.Colors`) — the alpha ramp

The **Dark column is the design and is frozen**; each value is the literal the forced-dark build
shipped. Light is the same stop with the ink inverted, and is the only column open to retuning.

| Token             | Dark           | Light          | Use                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `panelScrim`      | black **0.40** | white **0.55** | the panel scrim over the glass                   |
| `selection`       | white 0.10     | black 0.09     | selected row fill (keyboard/active selection)    |
| `rowHover`        | white 0.05     | black 0.045    | mouse-hover fill (always fainter than selection) |
| `menuHover`       | white 0.10     | black 0.09     | popover-menu row hover                           |
| `separator`       | white 0.10     | black 0.12     | a list↔preview hairline (clipboard, file search) |
| `controlSurface`  | white 0.10     | black 0.08     | filled keycaps, glyph tiles                      |
| `border`          | white 0.20     | black 0.18     | outlined keycap borders                          |
| `textPrimary`     | white 1.00     | black 1.00     | search text and caret, volume fill and knob      |
| `textSecondary`   | white 0.60     | black 0.60     | secondary labels                                 |
| `textTertiary`    | white 0.40     | black 0.42     | placeholders, trailing kind labels               |
| `menuSymbol`      | white 0.70     | black 0.70     | native popover-menu symbols                      |
| `iconPlaceholder` | white 0.06     | black 0.06     | the empty tile a row paints while an icon decodes |
| `sheen`           | white 0.04     | black 0.04     | the wash behind the Onboarding header            |
| `cardFill`        | white 0.05     | black 0.04     | settings/calc card fill                          |
| `cardStroke`      | white 0.10     | black 0.10     | settings/calc card border + inset dividers       |
| `noteText`        | white 0.90     | black 0.85     | Notes body text                                  |
| `dropGuide`       | white 0.35     | black 0.35     | the palette's drop guides while dragging         |

`panelScrim` is the ramp's inverse — it darkens the dark surface and lightens the light one — so it
is an `adaptive` pair, not a `ramp`.
`brand`, `primaryAction`, `destructive`, `success` and `dropGuideArmed` are fixed hues and adapt on
their own.

Beyond these, `.secondary`/`.tertiary` foreground styles are fine for SF Symbols (they resolve against
the environment's appearance). **Selection always beats hover** when a row is both.

An extension's own surfaces live in `ExtensionColors` (`Features/Extensions/UI/`), not here — the
`ramp` mechanism is shared, the values are the feature's. See the Extensions non-negotiable in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Panel structure

Source: `Palette/PalettePanel.swift`, `Palette/RootPaletteView.swift`.

- **`PalettePanel`** is a borderless `NSPanel`: `isOpaque = false`, `backgroundColor = .clear`, `.palette` level (one above `.modalPanel`, so other apps' open panels never cover it), `hasShadow`, `animationBehavior = .none`. It hosts SwiftUI via `NSHostingView`. `PaletteWindowController` centers it slightly above screen center (`+8%`) and dismisses it on `windowDidResignKey`.
- **The results layer fills the whole panel.** The header and bottom bar attach via `.safeAreaInset(edge: .top/.bottom)` as transparent overlays that float _over_ the list. The list underlaps them and dissolves at the edges.
- **Header** (`headerHeight 44`): a back-chevron _or_ mode glyph, then the plain `TextField` (no border/background). Sub-screens (Clipboard, Calculator History) show the back chevron; the launcher shows a magnifying glass. The search icon aligns horizontally with row content.
- **Compact keyboard entry:** pressing `↓` in the collapsed launcher expands the results and selects the first row without replacing or defocusing the shared search field.
- **Bottom bar** (`bottomBarHeight 52`): a menu circle on the left, the action group on the right — both floating glass, no bar background. The action group is one glass `Capsule` holding the primary-action pill (label + `↵`) and the Actions toggle (`⌘K`).
- **`BarButton`** is the shared bar control: bare label at rest, a `rowHover` capsule on hover, `barButtonHeight 28`. Set `isSelected` and it fills with `selection` instead, which beats hover; the Notes formatting bar lights its buttons this way. Set `isCompact` for `sm` padding instead of `md`: around a 16-point glyph frame that makes a 28-point square. It carries the footer's two buttons and the clipboard header's type filter, so those hover identically. Hover state lives inside it, so sweeping one never re-renders the palette body.

---

## Notes panel

Source: `Features/Notes/UI/`.

Notes is a sibling surface, not a palette mode. `NotesPanel` is a **titled**, resizable,
non-activating panel — AppKit draws the traffic lights, the drag and the resize — but it keeps the
palette's transparent recipe and deliberately does not dismiss on resign-key. `NotesView`'s root
applies `panelScrim` → `GlassEffectView()` → one continuous **`panel`** corner clip, so
Notes and the palette round identically. The clip is larger than the theme frame's own corner, so it
is what shows; `invalidateShadow()` on every show recuts the shadow to match.

The title bar is a 44-point band, and both halves of it are deliberate. `titleVisibility` is
`.hidden` and `NotesView` draws the title itself, centred on the **window**: a titlebar accessory
drops `NSThemeFrame` off its centred-title layout, so the native title would sit beside the traffic
lights. The drawn title is not hit-testable, so clicks fall through to the real title bar and drag
the window. The three actions cannot do that, so they live in an `NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController`
at `.trailing` — `NoteTitlebarActions`, the launcher's footer capsule (`BarButton` in a
`frosted(in: Capsule())`) with glyphs in place of pills. Its 44-point height is what sizes the band.

`NotesWindowController` no longer computes frames: the user owns the size, and AppKit autosaves both
position and size under `"Notes Window"`. The window shows exactly one surface at a time — editor,
switcher, or the "No Notes" empty state — and the character count is part of the editor surface, so
it never appears without a note.

The header keeps a fixed slot for status so Saving, Saved, failure, and conflict symbols cannot move
the controls. Failure and conflict symbols can be clicked to reopen their recovery report after a
dismissal. A title click opens the in-window note switcher; dragging the title, note icon, or otherwise
empty header moves the panel after a three-point threshold. Create, Reveal, Hide, and actionable status
remain click-only controls. Escape closes the switcher before hiding, while Command-W and the hide
control order the panel out. Show Notes only shows or focuses; focus loss leaves the panel visible.

The editor is one native TextKit 2 surface. Its string is the canonical Markdown source, and Render
Markdown styles it in place with no new tokens. Notes type sits one system text style above the rest
of the app, because a note is for reading: body text is the title3 size in `noteText`, and headings 1
to 3 use the largeTitle, title1 and title2 sizes (bold, bold, semibold). Interface Size does not scale
it. Inline code is monospaced on `controlSurface`, and links use the system link colour. Quotes and
checked tasks dim to `textSecondary`, and a checked task is struck through. Markers on the caret's line
show in `textTertiary`; everywhere else they are hidden. A revealed list or quote marker hangs left of
its text, so the text does not move when the caret arrives, unless the marker is wider than the slot.

A layout fragment draws the block chrome. A code band fills `cardFill` with `menu` corners at its ends
and a `textTertiary` language label, inset by `lg`. A quote bar is `markdownQuoteBar` wide in `border`,
stepping `markdownQuoteBar + lg` per depth. A rule is a `hairline` of `separator`. List markers sit in
a slot per level, `markdownListMarker` grown in proportion to the body size. Bullets, numbers and
checkboxes are `textSecondary`; a done box is filled with the check cut out. Headings 1 and 2 get `xl`
space above, the rest `md`, and `xs` below; every list item gets `md` below. A table stays literal
source in the code-block font, and a wrapped row hangs `lg` under its first line. AppKit owns editing,
undo, selection, Find, and marked text.

Under the editor, the formatting bar takes a `bottomBarHeight` band while Render Markdown and Show
Formatting Bar are on, in place of the 28-point count footer. It is one row, not a capsule hugging the
window: the count is plain text at the leading edge and the buttons sit in glass at the trailing edge,
the same split as the palette's own bottom bar. The capsule is the title bar's recipe (`BarButton`s in
`frosted(in: Capsule())`), inset `md` from the trailing edge as the title capsule is, with `xxs`
between buttons and `sm` between groups. Each button is a compact 28-point square
around a `noteGlyph` frame, so the capsule is 36 points wide collapsed and 397 expanded, and the count
gives way from 524 points down. Collapsing and expanding grows the buttons out of the round button on
`MenuMotion.chevronAnimation`, wrapped in an explicit `withAnimation` in the coordinator because the
chord changes that state outside any view's transaction, and skips the animation under Reduce Motion. The band takes only the width it is offered, so the bar can never widen the note; past that,
only the capsule's leading end clips. Lit buttons
use `BarButton.isSelected`; hovering shows a `Tooltip` with the name and shortcut, because an AppKit
tooltip does not appear while the app is inactive behind this non-activating panel. The glass is a
`background`, never a wrapper, and nothing clips the row, because either one swallows that tooltip. The
round button aligns its tooltip trailing and the heading button leading, so neither runs past the
window edge. The heading menu is a borderless child window like the switcher, `noteHeadingMenu` in
size, hung off the heading button's own reported frame and `xs` above it, drawn with
`PopoverMenuRow`'s metrics on `menuPanel` glass.

The switcher is its own glass panel over the editor, sized to its list up to a 240-point ceiling and
never resizing the note window. Its plain search field and
keyboard-navigable rows use the shared selection/hover ramp; rename and Trash remain row actions rather
than adding another toolbar or window.

The switcher exposes activation, Rename, and Move to Trash as VoiceOver actions with the actual note
title. Its hover buttons are hidden from accessibility so those actions are announced once. See
[features/notes.md](features/notes.md).

## AI Chat window

Source: `Features/AI/UI/AIChatSplitViewController.swift`, `AIChatDetailView.swift`.

AI Chat is a titled window built the way Settings is, not a palette sibling like Notes: a real
`NSSplitViewController` whose sidebar item takes the system sidebar material, a unified toolbar with
an inline title, and native `List`, `Menu` and context menus. Nothing about it scales with Interface
Size. The composer is untinted Liquid Glass at `Radius.dialog`, stacked under the transcript so nothing
scrolls behind it, with `.glass` capsules for its model and reasoning menus, and its glass on a
background layer rather than the box.
The title bar keeps the system's own toolbar band, as any document window's does. The context card
the gauge raises on hover is glass over a solid `windowBackgroundColor`, because it rises over
transcript text, and sits in the transcript's own frame at its bottom edge, so no window size can
push it off screen. A reply's choices are `.glass` capsules that rise out of the composer's top
edge. Find marks words in `Colors.findMatch` / `findCurrent`, the system yellow, with
`findCurrentInk` black on the solid one in both appearances. Transcript lines sit
`spacing.chatLine 4` apart on both surfaces. The transcript itself is the palette's `ChatTranscriptView`
with `surface: .window`, which leaves out `edgeDissolve` and `thinScrollbar` — both are measured
against the palette's bars — and caps the column at `aiChatReadingWidth`, centred.

## The edge dissolve

Source: `DesignSystem/Scrolling/EdgeDissolve.swift`.

The signature effect. A scroll-driven `LinearGradient` mask on each list so rows soften as they approach
a floating bar, ghost beneath it, and vanish only at the window edge. Attach with `.edgeDissolve()` on
the `ScrollView`, **before `.thinScrollbar()`** (so the scrollbar overlay stays unmasked).

- Fade bands: top = `headerHeight + headerPadding + 32`, bottom = `bottomBarHeight + 28` — each overshoots its bar into the visible list, so the ramp finishes ~32/28px _past_ the bar rather than cliffing at its edge.
- Alpha floors mid-scroll (not to 0): **top 0.15, bottom 0.25**, eased by how much content is hidden past the edge (`1 − (1 − floor)·clamp(dist/band, 0, 1)`).
- Only masks when the list is scrollable; the edge stop stays transparent so rubber-band bounces still dissolve. A list that fits gets no mask.
- The mask spans the scroll view's **full** frame (`.ignoresSafeArea()`) — otherwise the bars' safe-area insets shift the gradient onto at-rest rows.

**Palette only.** Every one of its call sites is a palette screen, and the bands above are measured
against the palette's bars. A Settings list underlaps nothing, so it uses `.overflowFade()` instead —
and so does the Notes switcher, whose search row is a sibling in a `VStack`, not a floating bar.

## The overflow fade

Source: `DesignSystem/Scrolling/OverflowFade.swift`.

The counterpart for any list with no bars over it — the Settings lists and the Notes switcher — and
deliberately a separate type: sharing one modifier would tie such a list to geometry that only means
something under a bar. Attach with `.overflowFade()` on the `ScrollView`, before `.thinScrollbar()`,
or pass `includingTop: true` for a bounded popup whose title and rows scroll together.

- **Bottom by default.** Settings and Notes have nothing above their lists; popups opt into the top
  edge because their content, including the title, can scroll past it.
- Fade band: **24px** with the original single-stop curve by default; popups opt into the progressive
  top-and-bottom curve and their own 30pt band.
- **No alpha floor.** Each enabled edge eases with how much content is hidden there and clears
  completely once the list rests against it.
- No `.ignoresSafeArea()`: a Settings list carries no bar insets to correct for.

## Rows, selection, hover

Source: `Launcher/UI/LauncherList.swift`, `Clipboard/UI/ClipboardView.swift`,
`FileSearch/UI/FileSearchList.swift`, `Uninstall/UI/UninstallView.swift`.

All lists share one row grammar so launcher and clipboard look identical:

- `HStack(spacing: lg)`: leading 24pt icon/thumbnail, title (`.body`, `lineLimit(1)`), optional trailing keycaps/kind label, `Spacer`. Insets: `.horizontal md`, `.vertical sm`.
- **The leading slot is always `Theme.Size.rowIcon`, whatever fills it.** A glyph smaller than an app icon — the uninstall list's 16pt checkbox — is centred _inside_ that 24pt slot rather than sizing the slot to itself. Every list then starts its title at the same x, so switching palette modes doesn't jog the column sideways. The slot doubles as the hit target.
- Background is a `RoundedRectangle(row, .continuous)` filled by `fill`: **selection → hover → clear**, in that precedence. This `fill` computed property is copy-identical across `AppRow`, `ClipboardRow` and `UninstallRow` — keep them in sync. The launcher's lead cards don't restate it: `.leadCard(selected:)` (`Features/Launcher/UI/LeadCard.swift`) owns their fill and hover, so a card can't answer a selection differently from its siblings.
- **Hover state lives on the row**, not the list, so a mouse sweep repaints only the rows entering/leaving (a list-level hover rebuilds every row per move — don't do that).
- **Hover is armed by pointer movement, not by the pointer's position** (`armedHover`, `Palette/HoverArming.swift`). A palette shown under a resting pointer lights nothing, and keys or a scroll drop the highlight until the pointer moves clear of the slop radius around where it stood — a row must never light up because it *slid under* a still pointer. Two measured facts the rule rests on: SwiftUI fires hover phases for rows arriving under a stationary pointer, but **not** for a lit row that merely shifts, so `PaletteState.hoverDisarmToken` clears what is already lit; and a wheel gesture ends with a mouse-moved event carrying no displacement, so *event type is not evidence the pointer moved*. `Tests/hover-arming-test.swift` pins both halves.
- **Scroll moves only on keyboard nav/reset**, driven by a `ScrollIntent` (`DesignSystem/Scrolling/ScrollIntent.swift`) — mouse selection targets a visible row and never yanks scroll. `.top` scrolls to the origin anchor that `scrollOriginAnchor()` installs — a zero-height overlay applied to the scrolled content _after_ its padding, so it marks offset 0 without joining the layout and the restored origin is exact (targeting the first row instead leaves the top padding hidden under the header); it is restated when the header's inset settles after mount, which moves the resting offset. A `.follow` that lands on flat index 0 restores the origin instead, so that row's section header comes back into view. One intent state serves every mode — they never coexist.
- **`.follow` is an invariant, not a command** (`scrollFollowsSelection`, `DesignSystem/Scrolling/`). Each list marks its selected row with `selectionFrame(_:)`, and the modifier keeps that row inside the band between the floating bars, re-checking as the geometry and the row's frame settle, then **stops watching the moment the row is inside**. That self-release is what keeps it safe: once a keystroke has landed nothing is observing, so a wheel scroll — or a scrollbar-thumb drag, which `onScrollPhaseChange` cannot see at all — is never pulled back. Two measured facts it rests on: `frame(in: .scrollView)` reports the *inset-excluded* space, so the band is simply `0…containerSize.height`; and SwiftUI's minimal scroll-to-visible counts the strip behind the bottom bar as visible while its *destination* math respects the insets. Hence the split — Tinycast decides **whether** to scroll (`SelectionReveal`, pure, pinned by `Tests/scroll-reveal-test.swift`) and SwiftUI performs the move with an explicit `.top`/`.bottom` anchor. Scroll far by hand and the lazy stack drops the selected row, so there is no frame to measure at all: the fallback brings it back by id and the invariant, still standing, re-checks the moment it reports — which is why arrowing after a long mouse scroll lands the selection on screen rather than moving it out of sight. A one-shot `scrollTo` here left the highlight stranded under the pill whenever the target row's layout was not yet known, with nothing looking again until the next key press. **The id passed to `scrollFollowsSelection` must be the lazy container's own `ForEach` identity** — an `.id()` applied inside a row registers only once that row has been realized, which is exactly when scrolling to it is unnecessary, and the fallback that brings a dropped row back by id then has nothing to aim at.
- **Keycaps** use `KeyCapChip`: `.outline` (white-0.20 border) for hotkey hints on rows, `.filled` (white-0.10 fill) for footer shortcuts.

### Section headers

All six palette lists (App Launcher, Clipboard, Emoji, File Search, Calculator History, Uninstall) render category labels
through one shared **`SectionHeader`** (`.subheadline.medium`, secondary — `Features/Launcher/UI/SectionHeader.swift`).
The launcher shows a single "Results" header over search matches, and per-kind sections
(Favorites / Applications / System Settings / Commands) for the empty query; clipboard/history use
date buckets (Today / Yesterday / …), and the clipboard adds a "Pinned" section above them holding
every pinned entry (filtered searches included).

Spacing lives in `Theme.Spacing`: `sectionHeaderBottom` (header → first row) and `sectionSpacing`
(gap above every header **except the list's first**, which reads as the previous section's closing
padding). Each list passes `isFirst: row.id == <rows>.first?.id` so only the very first row skips the
leading gap. Headers are non-selectable display rows, so selection (keyed by id) is unaffected.

## Liquid Glass

Source: `Theme.frosted(in:)`, `DesignSystem/PopoverMenu.swift`.

Glass is normally for floating controls. The dialog root is the one modal-surface exception.

- `View.frosted(in:)` = `glassEffect(.clear.interactive(), in:)` — clear, interactive lensing. Used on the action-group capsule, the menu circle and `PopoverMenu`. Dialogs intentionally use untinted, non-interactive `.glassEffect(.regular)` on their root instead; HUDs retain the panel recipe (see "Dialogs & HUD"). Retune it in `frosted(in:)`, not per call site.
- **Menus are in-window overlays, not system popovers.** `.contextMenu`/`NSMenu` stall clicks for seconds inside a `LazyVStack` and spill outside the panel. Use `PopoverMenu` anchored to a corner via `.overlay`, inset `menuInset` (8pt) so its own corner isn't clipped by the panel's. A menu hung off a control instead of a corner — the clipboard type filter, `.topTrailing` — insets by that control's own metrics so their edges line up.
- **A menu's `width` is fixed, never intrinsic**, so it can't jitter as its rows change. Every header menu states its own at its `RootPaletteView.menuContent` case — `menuWidth 276`, or a token of its own where that reads too wide (`clipboardFilterMenuWidth`, `fileSearchFilterMenuWidth`, `emojiCategoryMenuWidth`) — so retuning one never moves another. Native footer menus add 30pt without changing those header widths; extension Actions owns its nearby 310pt width inside the feature.
- **`PopoverMenu`** uses `glassEffect(.regular)` with `menuPanel 16` corners and **no hand-tuned shadow** — Tahoe glass carries its own elevation; adding a drop shadow reads heavy and non-native. A footer menu raises only its attached bottom corner to the controls' 18-point radius, so the two silhouettes meet exactly.
- Its native search field is a row-height sibling of the scroller, above header menus or below footer menus. It uses an 18pt horizontal inset to align with the visible row glyphs. The top field stays vertically symmetric; the bottom field keeps its 1pt optical lift. Menus omit the adjacent edge dissolve and centre **No Results** in one row when their filtered rows are empty. The 8pt resting list inset belongs to the scroll content, so rows can reach the surface edges without shifting their initial position; hover fills keep the dedicated `menuRow 10` corner.
- `PopoverMenuRow`: leading glyph, label, trailing shortcut glyph and `menuHover` fill on hover. Menus animate in with opacity and scale from the anchored corner, stretching briefly to 1.003 before settling; `Theme.MenuMotion` owns the entry, settle and exit timings.
- The glyph is a `PopoverMenuIcon`: `.symbol` (SF Symbol, `monochrome`, `menuSymbol` — or **red** when `isDestructive`) `.file` (a real app icon via `IconCache`, used by the paste rows to show the paste target) or `.thumbnail` (a picture's own preview, cropped to the slot, used by the chat's staged-file rows). `PopoverMenuItem` keeps a `systemImage:` convenience init, so symbol rows read exactly as before.
- **Every glyph kind shares one square `menuIcon` (20) slot**, which pins one row height. A native SF Symbol uses the dedicated 14pt Medium `menuSymbol` font; file and brand icons keep their own artwork sizing inside the same slot, and a thumbnail fills it.
- Menu rows use the `md` icon→label gap; the fixed slot adds the remaining optical slack.
- **A menu's rows are a `LazyVStack`**, so opening one builds only the rows in view: the model menu runs to hundreds, and laying all of them out took seconds. The viewport's height is worked out from the row count, never measured, so nothing needs the rest. The rows hold no AppKit control, which is what keeps a lazy stack safe here (see Settings lists below).

## Dialogs & HUD

Source: `Windows/Dialog/`, `Windows/HUD/`.

Tinycast owns its dialogs; `NSAlert` is never used. `DialogController` is owned by `AppCore` (the
sole owner rule) and is the only presenter, so every confirmation in the app looks and behaves alike.

- **Three independent axes.** The **icon** says _what_, the **tone** says _how serious_, the **button
  role** says _what happens if you click_. None of them derives another — that separation is the
  whole point of the design, and collapsing any two of them back together is a regression.
- **Icon.** `DialogRequest.symbol` is required and is always the subject's own glyph: a system
  command passes its `SystemAction.sfSymbol`, so the Restart dialog shows `arrow.clockwise` and
  Empty Trash shows `trash.slash` — the same glyph as the launcher row the user just activated.
  Custom commands use `terminal`, the backup flows `square.and.arrow.up` / `.down`. Symbols render
  through `SymbolImage` (`DesignSystem/SymbolImage.swift`), never raw `Image(systemName:)`, because some
  catalog symbols are bundled template assets rather than SF Symbols — `toggleBluetooth` ships its
  own artwork since the logo is a SIG trademark, and a raw `Image(systemName:)` draws nothing for it.
- **Tone.** `DialogTone` is `.neutral` (secondary gray), `.success` (green) or `.danger` (red), and
  it tints the leading glyph and nothing else. The dialog tile lifts a neutral glyph to
  `textSecondary` for the same legibility as a key-cap symbol; semantic colours stay unchanged.
  `.neutral` stays gray rather than system blue on purpose, since a hue here should mark a state the
  way the other two do, not decorate an otherwise neutral message. There is no separate
  warning-vs-error case: both read equally severe and were only ever told apart by the icon's shape,
  which the action-derived icon now owns.
  `MessageHUDController.show(message:tone:)` (the pill; see below) takes the same `DialogTone` for its
  status dot, so the pill and the dialogs speak one tint vocabulary even though they render it
  differently. `AppCore` derives a system action's tone from `SystemActionFeedback.isNoOp`, so
  "Trash Emptied" reads `.success` and "Trash Is Already Empty" reads `.neutral`, rather than every
  pill defaulting to the same green dot regardless of whether anything happened.
- **Button role.** `DialogAction.Role` colors the label: a default `.standard` action uses
  `primaryAction`, another `.standard` uses `Color.primary`, `.destructive` uses
  `Theme.Colors.destructive`, and `.cancel` uses `textSecondary`. Because role is independent of tone, a
  red-glyph security warning can carry a plain white button — "Import executable commands?" does,
  since importing a file destroys nothing — and running a shell command the user wrote themselves is
  `.neutral` + `.standard` rather than a red alarm.
- **Surface.** A dialog applies one system `.glassEffect(.regular)` to a
  `RoundedRectangle(panel 26)`. Confirmations and notices use `dialogCompactWidth 290`, including the
  volume slider; form dialogs use `dialogWidth 420`. `panelScrim` sits beneath the glass so the dialog
  keeps the launcher's darker density without losing the system material. `DialogPanel` clips its
  `NSHostingView` layer to the same continuous radius, then lets AppKit draw the native window shadow;
  this avoids both the rectangular outline of an unshaped panel and the hard bounds of a SwiftUI blur.
  The launcher's root gains a `dialogDimming` overlay only when it remains visible behind the panel;
  actions that hide the launcher first do no dimming work. Its fade follows `dialogEnter` / `dialogExit`
  so both surfaces separate as one transition. Matte button fills come from `controlSurface` /
  `selection`, while a destructive action uses the destructive tint. The **volume HUD** and **message
  pill** keep the non-glass panel recipe.
- **Layout.** Subject glyph in a low-opacity rounded tile, then title (`panelTitle`) + wrapped
  secondary message, optional accessory and full-width actions. Content uses a 22-point inset while
  the actions keep the tighter `dialogInset 18`. One action spans the row; two sit side by side with
  **Cancel rendered leading** only while both labels fit on one line, then `ViewThatFits` stacks them.
  Three or more always stack in the caller's semantic order. `DialogView.visualOrder` reorders only
  horizontal display;
  `onChoose(index)` still dispatches against `DialogRequest.actions`' original order, so a caller
  never has to think about layout position when it builds a request. Every role uses the regular
  callout face; semantic roles change colour, never weight. `dialogButtonHeight 34` is shared by the
  actions, dialog text fields and New Event segmented choices. The fields and segmented choices use
  the non-pill `row 10` radius.
- **Keys.** `DialogPanel.sendEvent` intercepts Esc and ↵ directly instead of relying on SwiftUI
  `onKeyPress`, so the keys work without anything inside the dialog holding focus. Buttons don't print
  a key cap; after `tooltipDelay` of deliberate hover, `.tooltip(keyCap:)` fades in the shared
  `Tooltip` tile holding an outlined `KeyCapChip` for the key the panel actually handles (`↵`, `⎋`).
  Only those two keys are ever advertised, so a shown cap cannot drift from dialog behavior.
  **↵ runs the dialog's primary action; Escape cancels**, on every dialog including destructive ones.
  Arrow keys walk the volume slider along the same 5% grid the volume commands use (`DialogPanel`
  reports `.increment` / `.decrement` and `DialogController` applies `VolumeLevel.stepped`, so the
  panel never learns what a volume step is); click-away resolves as a dismissal.
- **Async, not modal.** Presentation is `async` (`withCheckedContinuation`), so there is no nested run
  loop. A held hotkey can't stack dialogs: while one is up, a second request resolves immediately as a
  dismissal — which is why the old `isConfirmingCommand` re-entrancy flag is gone. The guard is keyed
  on the live continuation, not on the panel, so a dialog still fading out can't swallow the next one.
- **Entrance and exit.** A dialog starts 3pt below its final position at 8% opacity. AppKit moves the
  cached full-panel surface upward over `dialogEnter` (0.12s), with the alpha following the same curve
  so the fade masks the window's whole-pixel movement and the native shadow travels with the glass.
  There is no SwiftUI scale: scaling the content inside a full-size shadow produced a transient rim.
  Exit is an interruptible `fadeOut` over `dialogExit` (0.10s); its handler hides the window only if
  the alpha is still 0. The
  continuation resumes **before** that fade, so confirming Restart is never held up by animation.
  Other borderless surfaces retain the shared `Duration.enter` / `Duration.exit` timings and
  `PanelTransition` behavior.
- **Non-activating**, like the palette: the dialog takes key focus for its own keys without pulling app
  focus off whatever the user was in. It sits at `.dialog`, above the palette's `.palette`, and is
  centred on the **cursor's** display with the same slight optical lift the palette uses.
- **`VolumeSlider`** uses SwiftUI's native `Slider`, paired with a monospaced-digit percentage in the
  same `volumeReadout 38` slot the HUD uses, so the row does not resize between `0%` and `100%`.
  Pointer interaction stays native; the arrows still walk the 5% grid through `DialogPanel`.
- **`VolumeHUDController`'s box** is the readout for the volume/mute commands, since macOS only
  draws its own HUD for real media keys and a CoreAudio change would otherwise be silent. It exists
  because a level needs an actual bar and number, not a one-line message: speaker glyph
  (`dialogIcon 32`, neutral `Color.primary` — a level isn't a success/warning statement), the bar, then
  the level as monospaced text beside it, in a fixed `volumeReadout 38` slot so the track can't resize
  as the number runs 0% → 100% — the same trick `VolumeSlider` uses, since the two now read as one
  control in two places. That slot is measured, not guessed: 38 is the widest string it ever holds
  ("Muted", 36pt in `rowTrailing`) plus a hair, because every point of slack is subtracted straight off
  the track. Fixed `hudWidth 200 × hudHeight 100`, with **asymmetric padding** — `xxl` 20 vertical,
  `xl` 12 horizontal — since 20pt of side padding costs a fifth of a 200pt box where the same token on
  a 420pt dialog costs a twentieth, and the bar is the content here.
  Muted prints `Muted`, not `0%`: the bar is already empty, so a
  number would either contradict it or hide the level the user comes back to. Auto-dismisses after
  `Duration.volumeHUD` (1.6s); a repeat command updates the shared `VolumeState` and calls
  `HUDPresenter.extend()`, so the bar slides to its new value in place instead of replaying the
  entrance.
- **`MessageHUDController`'s pill** is every _other_ transient
  confirmation: Custom Commands and Snippets confirming a run, and every system action whose effect
  is invisible (`Trash Emptied`, `Hidden Files Shown`, `Bluetooth Off`). One capsule shape, sized to
  its message (`hudMaxWidth 420` ceiling), clipped to a `Capsule()`, with the message first and a
  filled glyph trailing it: `checkmark.circle.fill` green for `.success`, `exclamationmark.circle.fill`
  red for `.danger`, `info.circle.fill` secondary for `.neutral`. **Here the glyph is the tone** — the
  one place that's true, because a pill has no subject to name the way a dialog does; the message
  already says what happened ("Trash Emptied"), so the icon only has to say how it went. The mapping is
  `fileprivate` in `MessageHUDView.swift` precisely so nobody can reach for it when building a
  `DialogRequest`, where the icon rule is the opposite. It trails rather than leads because a pill is
  read left to right and the outcome is the last thing you want to land on. Auto-dismisses after
  `Duration.messageHUD` (2.4s) — longer than the volume box, since a sentence needs reading time and a
  level only needs a glance — and a repeat call replaces rather than stacks.
- **The same pill reports work still running**, through `showProgress(message:)`: a Quick Action set to
  replace has no panel to watch the answer arrive in, so the pill says `Fixing Grammar…` in its place
  and the result message replaces it when the model is done. Its trailing mark is a spinner rather
  than a tone, which is why `MessageHUDView.Accessory` exists — a tone says how something *went*, and
  nothing has gone anywhere yet. The spinner is **`progress.indicator` with
  `.symbolEffect(.variableColor)`, never a `ProgressView`**: AppKit draws that one itself and ignores
  every tint given to it, so a blue spinner is only reachable as a symbol. Progress has no natural
  dwell, so it is shown with `dwells: false` and stays up until something replaces it or
  `HUDPresenter.dismiss()` runs — the caller owns that, and `QuickActionCoordinator.produce` pairs the
  two with a `defer` so a throw or a cancellation cannot strand it.
- **`HUDPresenter`** is what keeps those two controllers from duplicating each other: one panel at a
  time, replace rather than stack, fade in, sit out its dwell, fade away, centred horizontally on
  a screen. The two HUDs differ only in their content, their anchor (`edgeInset(hudEdgeOffset 48)` for
  the pill, `heightFraction(0.12)` for the box) and how long they dwell — so those are the presenter's
  three arguments. **It sizes its window from a local, never from `host.frame` after attaching the
  content view**: assigning a content view resizes it to the window's current content rect, which is
  zero on a fresh panel, and a zero-width window "centers" with its leading edge on the screen's
  midline — visible only on the session's first HUD, which is what makes it easy to miss. Add a
  third HUD by constructing another presenter, not by teaching an existing controller a second shape.

## Scrollbars

Source: `DesignSystem/Scrolling/ThinScrollbar.swift`.

Custom thin overlay scrollbar (the native one flashes and reserves a gutter inside a transparent panel).
`.hideNativeScrollers()` on the scroll _content_ forces the backing `NSScrollView` to a hidden `.overlay`
style; `.thinScrollbar()` on the scroll view draws a hairline thumb (`Color.primary` alpha 0.30 rest →
0.42 hover → 0.5 drag) that fattens on hover, with a faint rail revealed only while hovering/dragging.

Routing: the palette lists (App Launcher, Clipboard history, Emoji, File Search, Calculator history) use
`.thinScrollbar()` + `.hideNativeScrollers()`; the Clipboard preview (right pane), every Settings
pane and the update window take the native scroller as-is. Don't reintroduce native scrollers on the palette lists.

**Native scrollers are overlay app-wide, set once.** `AppDelegate.applicationWillFinishLaunching`
writes `AppleShowScrollBars = WhenScrolling` into Tinycast's own defaults domain, which outranks the
global one. Under the system's "Automatic" setting AppKit otherwise switches every scroll view to
thick legacy scrollers the moment it sees a mouse — a scroll view is born overlay and flips ~half a
second later, which read as a thick bar flashing at the right edge of each pane. There is no
per-scroll-view shim: chasing that flip after the fact is what caused the flash.

---

## The camera preview panel

`CameraPreviewPanel` is the third borderless surface, beside the dialog and the notes panel. It takes
the same recipe — `panelScrim`, then `GlassEffectView`, then the clip — and the same optical lift a
dialog takes, but sits at `.floating` rather than `.dialog` so a failure report still lands on
top of it.

`AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` is hosted in one `NSViewRepresentable` and nothing else; the title,
countdown and buttons around it are Tinycast's own. Its buttons are a **deliberate copy** of
`DialogButton` rather than a share: the dialog owns its button, and a preview that had to move with
it would couple two unrelated surfaces.

## Dialog accessories

A dialog carries at most one control beyond its buttons, and `DialogAccessory` makes that structural
rather than a convention — `.volume` for the Set Volume prompt, `.eventDraft` for New Event,
`.snippetArguments` for a snippet's `{argument}` values. Text fields take `dialogTextField()`;
New Event groups its fixed start and duration values into two local segmented bars, while a snippet's
inline enumerated arguments remain `DialogChip`s. Two things follow from the enum:

- **Arrow keys belong to the accessory, not the panel.** `DialogPanel.handlesArrowKeys` is set from
  `DialogAccessory.claimsArrowKeys`, so the slider still steps on ←/→ while the New Event title field
  keeps its caret.
- **An accessory can refuse its own primary action.** An invalid draft leaves the dialog up on ↵ and
  on a click alike, which is what a greyed-out button would say if `DialogAction` could carry one.

## Settings

Source: `DesignSystem/SettingsComponents.swift`.

Settings runs in its own resizable `NSWindow` (the SwiftUI `Settings` scene is unreliable for accessory
apps) with real traffic lights and a lifecycle wholly its own. It does not share the palette's look: **every pane is a stock
`Form` with `.formStyle(.grouped)`**, so the cards, headers, row insets and hairlines are all
system-drawn and a pane reads exactly as macOS System Settings does.

- **A row is a stock control.** `LabeledContent`, `Toggle` or `Picker`, each with a two-view label —
  the first view is the title, the rest become the secondary subtitle. Never a hand-built `HStack`
  with its own padding.
- **A row with a custom trailing control uses `SettingsRow`, not `LabeledContent`.** `LabeledContent`
  wraps its value in a selectable text field, which swallows the taps a `ShortcutRecorder` needs —
  the recorder renders but never starts recording. Stock `Toggle`/`Picker`/`Button` trailing content
  is unaffected.
- **`.settingsEnabled(_:)`, never a bare `.disabled(_:)`.** It dims as well as disables, so a
  switched-off row reads as unavailable rather than merely unresponsive.
- **A secret is a `RevealableSecureField`, never a bare `SecureField`.** One eye, one place, so an API
  key, a header value and a passphrase all offer the same way to check a pasted value before saving.
  It re-hides on its own once the field is cleared, and its eye is disabled while it is empty.
  A password field an extension declares, in a form or a preference, is left as it was.
- **A `TextEditor` ignores `.disabled(_:)` on macOS** — its own and an ancestor's alike. The backing
  `NSTextView` keeps its caret, its keyboard and its selection, so a "disabled" prompt box still takes
  typing and still gives up its text to ⌘A ⌘C. Swap the editor for a `Text` when it must be read-only,
  the way `SystemPromptEditor` does; dimming an editor that still accepts input is the bug, not the fix.
- **A group is a `Section`**, with `header:` for its name and `footer:` for the caption that used to
  ride under the last row.
- **A pane scans as section → setting → control, so its words are rationed.** A subtitle is a short
  phrase, and only where the title leaves out a consequence or a limit ("Shortcuts still work when
  hidden."); a footer carries a caveat, such as privacy or cost, never a restatement of its header. A
  fact every list would repeat lives once, in a tooltip — `launcherVisibilityHelp()` on each launcher
  checkbox.
- **Settings is one SwiftUI `NavigationSplitView`** (`SettingsRootView`), hosted with
  `sceneBridgingOptions = [.toolbars, .title]` so its toolbar, title and search field reach the AppKit
  window. It was an `NSSplitViewController`; in that sidebar every search bar drew a hard scroll edge
  with a hairline, which no `scrollEdgeEffectStyle` or accessory style could soften.
  `.toolbar(removing: .sidebarToggle)` goes *before* `navigationSplitViewColumnWidth`, or the column
  shrinks to AppKit's default thickness.
- **The pane's own title is not in the pane.** `.navigationTitle` puts it in the titlebar beside the
  Back/Forward chevrons. `SettingsWindowChrome` installs *before* the content mounts: the bridged toolbar
  restores the title flags it mounted over, so a later `titleVisibility = .visible` is undone on the
  first navigation.
- **Settings and AI Chat are the windows that keep the system titlebar.** `AppWindowController` builds
  every window with `titlebarAppearsTransparent = true`, which opts the titlebar out of the system's
  glass band; `SettingsWindowChrome.install(in:)` and `AIChatWindowChrome.install(in:)` set it back to
  `false`, so the band and its scroll edge effect are drawn by AppKit as a pane's `Form` or the
  transcript scrolls under it. `.fullSizeContentView` and `titlebarSeparatorStyle = .none` stay — the
  content still runs under the bar, and a hairline would split the surface the band unifies. Both also
  clear `isMovableByWindowBackground`: stock Settings isn't dragged by its content, and a drag across a
  transcript selects text. Onboarding, Updates, Support and Command Output keep the transparent
  titlebar they were tuned for. Never hand-draw a header band; a main surface takes the system's
  material, not `glassEffect`.
- `SettingsComponents.swift` holds only what more than one pane or editor needs: **`SettingsRow`**,
  **`FeatureSwitchSection`** (a feature's master switch plus its launcher-visibility companion),
  **`SettingsFilterField`** (the filter row above a long list), **`launcherVisibilityHelp()`**, and the
  Settings editor header, fields and surface. `ModalActionButtonStyle.swift` keeps every borderless surface's actions on one
  implementation — dialogs, Settings editors, the camera footers and the Quick Action panel. `Onboarding/OnboardingCard.swift` keeps the older hand-drawn card,
  which that window still uses.
- **A Settings editor borrows the dialog language, not its job.** `SettingsEditorPresenter` hosts the
  existing form in an activating, transparent child `NSPanel`, with the same `panel 26` Liquid Glass
  surface, 3pt/8% entrance and matte action buttons. A blocking child covers and dims the whole parent,
  including its titlebar; nested editors form one stack owned by the Settings-window session. The
  presenting binding remains the dismissal source of truth, while launcher handoffs are consumed into
  pane-local state so opening an editor does not repaint the split view. A list that can keep growing
  scrolls at a stated row count instead — Custom Commands caps its arguments at `visibleArgumentRows` —
  so a panel's height stays a property of the editor, not of what has been typed into it. Extension
  editor visuals stay inside `Features/Extensions/`; the shared presenter treats them as opaque content.
- **The sidebar searches every pane *and* its rows.** `.searchable(placement: .sidebar)` sits above the list and
  swaps it for a flat, ranked result list; each result carries the pane's `systemImage`, the row's
  title and a `Pane › Section` breadcrumb, and arrowing through them moves the pane, as System
  Settings does. Selection runs through `SettingsNavigationState.select`, so a result is an ordinary
  navigation the Back/Forward chevrons can walk. **A row result also reveals its section**: the pane
  scrolls the matched setting to centre and pulses its own name once (`Colors.searchFlash`) before
  settling; a result no single row answers pulses the section's header instead.
  It is a **second `List`**, keyed by
  `SettingsSearchEntry.ID`, so result identities never share a selection namespace with `SettingsTab`.
  ⌘F focuses the field, Escape clears it.
- **`SettingsSearchCatalog` is hand-written, and that is the only option.** A `Form` cannot be asked
  what rows it holds, so a new row is searchable only once it is listed there — with its anchor, its
  title and the keywords the title doesn't contain ("caps lock" for Hyper Key).
  Matching reuses `FuzzyMatch` (`Launcher/Model/SearchRelevance.swift`), multi-term like `NoteSearch`:
  every term must hit the title, the breadcrumb or a keyword, a title hit outranks the rest, and a
  pane outranks its own rows so a bare "clipboard" lands on the pane. `Tests/settings-history-test.swift`
  pins that every pane is covered and that identities are unique; row-level drift is caught in review.
  **Match ranges are deliberately not highlighted** — `FuzzyMatch` returns tier and score only.
- **`SettingsAnchor` names a section once, so the catalog and the pane cannot disagree.** An entry
  takes its pane *from* the anchor, so a row filed under the wrong pane won't compile.
  `SettingsSectionHeader(_:)` in a section's `header:` supplies the name and the id a group result
  scrolls to; `SettingsRowTitle(_:_:)` stands in for the `Text` of a row's own label and does the
  same for one setting. A section with no header of its own takes `.settingsAnchor(_:)`, an id and
  nothing else. **A catalog entry is `.init(anchor, title)` for one row and `.init(group:_:)` when
  no single row answers it** — a list, a section's master switch, a button that lives in another
  row's trailing edge. The half the compiler can't reach — a target nothing declares, which
  navigates and then sits there — is caught by `Scripts/check-settings-search.js`, run from
  `Scripts/lint.sh`. **Add the entry and its marker together, or lint will say so.**
- **The reveal lives in two modifiers, never in a pane** (`SettingsScrollTarget.swift`).
  `.settingsScrollTarget()` on a pane's `Form` holds the `ScrollViewReader` and one `.task(id:)` keyed
  on the request, so a second jump cancels the first mid-pulse and the pane releases the request when
  it settles; `.settingsAnchor(_:)` on a `Section` supplies the `.id` and paints the wash, reading
  which anchor is lit from `\.settingsFlash` rather than having it threaded down.
  `SettingsScrollRequest` carries a token because picking the same result twice has to scroll again
  rather than compare equal and do nothing.
- **The pulse is a pill on the name, and nothing around it is touched.** A grouped `Form` applies a
  `.background` to a row's whole *content* box, so lighting a section — or a row — paints ragged
  blocks at the width of every label, button and footer paragraph in it. (`.listRowBackground` is a
  no-op here, at section and at row level, and `.overlay` strokes every row separately.) Putting the
  pill on the label instead is one fixed shape nothing can render badly, it leaves each row's
  subtitle and control alone, and it marks exactly the words the result row showed.
- **The light is the window's, not the pane's** (`SettingsNavigationState.flashing`). Both panes are
  briefly alive across a swap, so a pane-local `@State` pulse dies with the pane that lit it, and an
  `@Environment` value doesn't reliably repaint an already-realized `Form` row. Two rules fall out:
  a cancelled reveal returns *without* ending the pulse, since cancellation means a later jump owns
  the light now; and `scrollRequest` is released only once the pulse is over, because it keys the
  pane's `.task(id:)` and clearing it early cancels the very task doing the revealing.
- **The sidebar's field is the system's, not `SettingsFilterField`.** That one is borderless because
  it lives inside a `Form` row; the sidebar's is `.searchable`, which AppKit seats as a split-item
  accessory with a soft scroll edge — the list blurs out under it, as in System Settings.
- **A `Form` realizes every row it is handed, and a lazy stack rebuilds a row's AppKit controls.**
  Handed 400 apps directly, a `Form` took 750 ms and 2040 views; a `LazyVStack` in one Form row
  fixed that, but tears a row's `TextField` and checkbox — both `NSView`s — down when the row scrolls
  off and builds them again when one scrolls on, about 7 ms and 4 ms on macOS 27. A fast scrollbar
  drag replaces a screenful of rows per update, so the list froze for 100–400 ms at a time.
  `LauncherItemsSection` therefore holds its items in `LauncherItemsTable`, an `NSTableView` filling
  one Form row: it keeps a screenful of cells and hands each a new entry, and each cell hosts the
  SwiftUI `LauncherItemRow`, so a reused row's controls update in place. A hosted row inherits nothing
  from the pane, so the table injects the stores the row reads, and moves Tab on to the next row's
  alias field itself; rows are a fixed 54 pt. A negative `.padding` doesn't move an AppKit view, so the
  table hangs 15 pt past its own view into the Form row's padding, where the lazy stack's rows sat.
  A long list whose rows hold no AppKit control can stay a `LazyVStack`.

### The window-layout editor

`Theme.Size.layoutEditorSheet` is **900 × 660, both stated**. The width less
`layoutInspectorColumn` (300) leaves the preview two thirds of the panel, and the canvas is greedy
inside it — a fixed preview box would spend that third on margin. **The height is stated because the
inspector grows**: picking an app reveals Argument, Size, Offset and Position, and an intrinsic
panel would jump out from under the pointer mid-click. The inspector scrolls if it ever overflows.

Every inspector control — text field, dropdown, add button — is one `layoutFieldChrome`: a
`Radius.barControl` rounded rect at `layoutControlHeight`, `cardFill` on `cardStroke`, accent-stroked
while focused. A numeric field fills its half of the row rather than sizing to a stated width, so a
value can never be cropped, and `layoutFieldUnit` keeps "%" and "pt" on one x.

**The entry dropdown is a button and a popover, not a `Menu`**: a menu label stretches an `NSImage`
out of aspect, which is what made the app icon smear. The rest of the app already picks apps this
way (`AppPickerPopover`).

In the position grid the **glyph floats in a wider cell** carrying the `contentShape`, so a click
anywhere in the cell lands — a bare stroke is hittable only on the line itself. Each anchor's block
takes half a pinned axis and all of a spanned one, which is what makes nine cells nine silhouettes
rather than nine identical rectangles.

`layoutPreviewGround` is **`adaptive`, never `ramp`**: a drawn display is dark in both appearances,
and a ramp would invert it in Light. `layoutPreviewWindow` is white in both for the same reason — it
sits on that always-dark plate. `Radius.glyph` (2) exists because `thumbnail` rounds a 10 pt square
into a circle.

The Save button draws a `⌘ ↵` cap, which the no-caps-on-buttons rule above otherwise forbids. That
rule guards against a printed cap drifting from what `DialogPanel.sendEvent` handles separately; here
the cap and the behaviour come from one `.keyboardShortcut`, so the drift is structurally impossible.
See [features/window-layouts.md](features/window-layouts.md#the-editor).

### The shortcut recorder callout

`ShortcutRecorder` is a **120pt** field showing only the binding — a combo's modifiers collapse into
one cap (`HotKeyBinding.compactKeycaps`), so any shortcut fits in two chips. Recording is narrated by
`ShortcutRecorderPopover`, a small **132 × 82** callout above it: caps, one label line, an `esc` cap in
the top-left corner. Its fixed frame shows the prompt (`⌥ A` at half opacity, "Type a
shortcut"), live held keys, a pending second Globe tap, or a conflict (rejected caps + owner, orange).

- **An ancestor draws it.** The open recorder publishes its bounds via `ShortcutRecorderAnchorKey`;
  `.shortcutRecorderPopoverHost()` sits on `SettingsDetailView` — one host above every pane's
  `Form`, and on `OnboardingView`. An overlay on the row would be clipped by the scroll view. A
  recorder in a `LauncherItemsTable` cell sits in its own hosting view, where the preference stops,
  so the cell reports the recorder's frame and `LauncherItemsSection` republishes it as the anchor.
- **`shortcutPopover.width` is load-bearing.** The callout centres on the recorder only while it
  fits either side of it; wider than that and the clamp kicks in and skews the caret.
  `Tests/callout-test.swift` pins this.
- **One glass shape.** `CalloutShape` (`HotKeys/UI/`) draws body and caret as a single path so `glassEffect`
  lenses them together. The caret is two straight edges meeting at an arc — a rounded-tip triangle,
  not a dome. Stock `.regular` glass, no hand-tuned shadow, as in `PopoverMenu`.
- **Placement is pure.** `CalloutPlacement` (`HotKeys/UI/`) picks above-vs-below, clamps, and walks the caret;
  the harness compiles it against the real `Theme` so a retuned token can't outdate the assertions.
- **`KeyCapChip.Scale`** is `compact` / `standard` / `hero` — three tokenised sizes, no stray frames.
- `allowsHitTesting(false)`: clicks reach the capture session's mouse monitor; a click on the active
  recorder toggles it off, and a click elsewhere closes it.

The calculator's inline `CalculatorCard` reuses this card language (`cardFill` + `cardStroke`) rather than the row language, since it's a highlighted answer, not a list item. A value answer is a **two-column** layout: a source column (input echo) and a target column (result), separated by a centered `arrow.right` glyph (no divider line). `LeadCardColumn` is that column, pill included, so the colour card is built from the same part rather than a copy of it. Each column optionally carries a word-name **badge pill** beneath its value (`keyCap` font, `controlSurface` fill, `keyCap` radius) — `Expression`→`Result` for scalar arithmetic, unit or currency names for typed results (`Expression`→`Kilograms`), and moment labels for a date/time calc (`12:18 AM`→`9:00 AM`, `Friday, 24 July`→`Friday, 9 April, 2027`). A trailing operator keeps the last complete result and its badge visible while the next operand is being typed.

## The palette search field

Its placeholder is drawn by Tinycast, not by the field's `prompt` — an `NSTextField` renders a prompt
through either its cell or its (one point taller) field editor, so a real prompt steps vertically when
focus moves. Don't reintroduce `prompt:` on that field. Drawing it costs one thing the real prompt
gets free: it must be gated on `PaletteState.isComposing` as well as an empty query, or it sits under
an IME's marked text. See
[features/palette.md](features/palette.md#the-placeholder-is-tinycasts-not-the-fields).

## Rules for agents working on the UI

- **Restyle from rendered screenshots, not guessed values.** Compare rendered screenshots over a light desktop. There's no screen-recording from the shell here — verify AppKit rendering with a `swiftc` harness that prints layer state, and let the user do visual sign-off.
- **Don't add behavior that wasn't requested.** A restyle changes appearance, not interaction — keep selection/scroll/dismiss/focus flows exactly as they are unless the task is about them.
- **New tokens go in `Theme`**, referenced everywhere. No magic numbers in views.
- **Keep the shared grammar shared.** If you change row insets, the `fill` precedence, section-header style, or keycap style, change it for _all_ lists — divergence is the bug, not the feature.
- **Build & verify** with the real toolchain (see [`development.md`](development.md)); a design change that doesn't compile under Swift 6 mode isn't done.
