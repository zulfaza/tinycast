description: Tinycast's one window, how to move around it, and how to adjust it.
---

Almost everything in Tinycast happens in one floating panel. The launcher is the root screen, and
every other feature is a screen you open from it. <kbd>esc</kbd> takes you back one screen at a time.

## Moving around

| Key                           | Does                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>return</kbd>             | The main action for the selection                    |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>return</kbd> | The second action, usually Show in Finder or Copy    |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>      | Open the Actions menu for the selection              |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd>     | Move the selection                                   |
| <kbd>tab</kbd>                | Move between the launcher, AI Chat and the clipboard |
| <kbd>esc</kbd>                | Clear the search, then go back a screen, then close  |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>esc</kbd>    | Go back to the root search from any screen           |
| <kbd>delete</kbd>             | In an empty search field, go back one screen         |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>      | Open Settings                                        |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>W</kbd>      | Close the window                                     |

<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd> is the best way to learn the app. Every screen lists all of its actions
there, each with its shortcut. The full list is in [Keyboard shortcuts](/docs/reference/shortcuts).

Every screen except the launcher has a back arrow in the top-left corner. Hover over it to see
whether clicking goes back a step or closes the window.

<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>esc</kbd> needs the [Accessibility permission](/docs/permissions), because macOS
uses that shortcut itself unless Tinycast intercepts it first.

### Emacs chords

These work anywhere in the palette:

| Chord                    | Same as      |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>N</kbd> | <kbd>↓</kbd> |
| <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> | <kbd>↑</kbd> |
| <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>F</kbd> | <kbd>→</kbd> |
| <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>B</kbd> | <kbd>←</kbd> |

On the [emoji grid](/docs/features/emoji), all four move the selection. Everywhere else,
<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>F</kbd> and <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>B</kbd> move the text cursor, which is what you
usually want in a search field. Chords with an extra modifier, like
<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd>, are ignored.

Shortcuts follow key positions, not the characters your input source types. If you use Japanese,
Russian or another non-Latin layout, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd> is still <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>.

## Tab moves between three screens

<kbd>tab</kbd> cycles through three screens: **launcher → AI Chat → clipboard → launcher**.

- From the launcher, <kbd>tab</kbd> sends whatever you typed to a new AI chat as a question. When
  this will happen, the header shows an **AI Chat** hint next to a <kbd>tab</kbd> key.
- From the clipboard, your search text carries over to the launcher.
- <kbd>esc</kbd> goes back through the screens in reverse.

AI Chat is skipped while [AI](/docs/ai) is off, and the clipboard is skipped while
[clipboard history](/docs/features/clipboard) is off.

Other screens, like Calculator History or Search Quicklinks, aren't part of the cycle. You only reach
them by opening them yourself.

There's one exception: when the selected row takes arguments, like a
[quicklink](/docs/launcher/quicklinks) or an [extension command](/docs/extensions),
<kbd>tab</kbd> moves through its fields first.

## How screens stack

If you open a screen by typing its name in the launcher, it opens on top of the launcher, and
<kbd>esc</kbd> takes you back to your search.

If you open a screen with its own global shortcut, it opens by itself with nothing behind it. Press
the shortcut again to close it.

**Settings → General → Escape Key Behavior** sets what <kbd>esc</kbd> does when the search is empty:

- **Navigate back or close window** (default): go back a screen, and close only at the root.
- **Close window and pop to root**: close right away, and start at the launcher next time.

In both cases, the first press clears any text you typed.

## Where it opens

Both placement settings are in **Settings → General → Appearance**.

**Follow the cursor across displays** (on by default) opens the palette on the display your pointer
is on. Turn it off to always use the display with the menu bar.

**Drag to reposition** (off by default) lets you move the panel. Drag the thin strip above the
search field, the empty space in the header, or the search field itself while it's empty.

While you drag, dotted guides show the default position and light up when you're close enough to
snap to it. Release there and the palette snaps back. Release anywhere else and Tinycast remembers
that position, even after a restart.

Tinycast forgets a saved position only when no display can show it anymore, for example after you
unplug a monitor. Positions aren't included in backups, since they don't carry over between Macs.

## Appearance

**Settings → General → Appearance** has these settings:

| Setting                        | Options                                | Default     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Theme                          | System · Light · Dark                  | **System**  |
| Interface size                 | Default · Large · Larger               | **Default** |
| Background transparency        | A slider from Less to More, with Reset | Middle      |
| Compact mode                   | On · Off                               | Off         |
| Show favorites in compact mode | On · Off                               | On          |

**Theme.** System follows macOS whenever it changes. Light uses the same design with inverted
colors, and the layout, type and animations stay the same.

**Interface size** makes the palette and its floating windows 10% or 20% larger. The Settings window
stays the same size.

**Background transparency** sets how much of the desktop shows through the glass. **Reset** restores
the original look.

**Compact mode** opens the launcher as a slim search bar that expands into the full list as you
type. <kbd>↓</kbd> expands it and selects the first row. With **Show favorites in compact mode** on,
your favorite apps appear at the right of the bar. See [Favorites](/docs/launcher/favorites).

The [Toggle System Appearance](/docs/launcher/system-actions) action changes the appearance of
_macOS itself_. Tinycast follows it only while its own theme is set to System.

## Input source

**Settings → General → Auto-switch input source** picks a keyboard layout to use while the palette
is open.

This helps if you type Japanese or Chinese most of the day but your app names use Latin letters.
Tinycast switches layouts when the palette opens and switches back when it closes. If you changed
the layout yourself while the palette was open, Tinycast keeps your choice.

## Pop to root

**Settings → General → Pop to Root Search** sets how long after the window closes Tinycast returns
to the launcher: **Immediately** (default), or after 5, 15, 30, 60 or 90 seconds.

Use a longer delay if you often close the palette and then come back to the same screen.

AI Chat has its own setting for reopening a conversation. See
[AI Chat](/docs/ai#coming-back-to-a-chat).

## The menu bar

The Tinycast menu bar icon has **Open Tinycast**, **Clipboard History**, **Settings…**,
**Check for Updates…**, **Support Tinycast…** and **Quit Tinycast**.

**Settings → General → Show in menu bar** hides the icon. Your shortcuts still work without it.
